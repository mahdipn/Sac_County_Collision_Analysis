# Identifying Contributing Factors to Collision Severity in Sacramento County, CA.

## Introduction
Each year, more than 40,000 road users get killed on the roadways in the US. Despite considerable advances in the vehicle industry and the safety of occupants, the existing safety trend is yet a major concern. Addressing this trend needs a thorough understanding of collision causes. In other words, identifying the collision causes is one of the major steps towards a successful, data-driven safety enhancement. To this end, we explored the contributing factors to collision and their higher injury severity in Sacramento, CA.

## Data
For this study, we used the collision data in unincorporated Sacramento County for the most recent 5-year period, i.e., 2015 through 2019. The data is publicly available through the SWITRS collision database. A review of the data identifies 99,590 collisions during the study period. The figure below shows clearly that there is no downward trend in the frequency of collisions. This is exactly the issue that we were talking about that needs a close investigation.
